# GetTrades

## Description
This project was made for managing an automated trading daily in an Excel's workbook, it provides 2 main funcionalities for this purpose:
1. Get all your trades from all your diferent coins in binance and sort the data in a table.
2. Get the current value of all the coins you've ever traded in order and sort the data in another table. d

The purpose this code was created is not only to get all your trades, but also get the binance value of all that coins for you to take a view of your current economical status.

## Languages
- Python.

## Libraries
- [python-binance](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Developing enviroment used
- Visual Studio Code (coding).
- Windows CMD (running/testing).

## Installation
First to say, the actual repository is uncompleted, then it won't work if to try running the main file.

If you check the source code you'll notice there's a Client.py file missing, that's because there's where are stored the API credentials. In order to adapting your own code you'll have to create this file by yourself adding the 'api_key' and 'secret_key' variables. Also you need to specify the filw the code will modify .

On the other hand, I created this code for being runned in my personal PC, then, the way I run it is through a virtual enviroment from which I had to install python-binance and openpyxl libraries, previously intalled python on my device. These are the steps you'll have to follow if you want to run it the way I do.

## Notes
- I'm kind of newbie using python and this is my first project on it. Surely I got a lot of things that could be significally improved on my code, so please feel free to make me know what could I done better and please modify my code for making something great for us all :D.
- Please **NEVER** code when you are tired :).
